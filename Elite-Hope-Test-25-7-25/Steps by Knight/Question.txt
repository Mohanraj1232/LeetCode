Given a square chessboard of size (n x n), the initial position and target postion of Knight are given. Find out the minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the target position.

Note: The initial and the target position coordinates of Knight have been given according to 1-base indexing.

Examples:

Input: n = 3, knightPos[] = [3, 3], targetPos[]= [1, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Knight takes 1 step to reach from 
(3, 3) to (1 ,2).
Input: n = 6, knightPos[] = [4, 5],targetPos[] = [1, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation:

Knight takes 3 step to reach from 
(4, 5) to (1, 1):
(4, 5) -> (5, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (1, 1).
Constraints:
1 <= n<= 1000
1 <= knightpos â‰¤ [x, y], targertpos[x, y] â‰¤  n
